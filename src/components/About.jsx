          <p>
          Software engineer with strong web development, product design, and leadership experience.
          I utilize Javascript, React and Redux to build dynamic front-end views,
          as well as my experience in Node.js/Express, Redis, and several SQL or NoSQL databases
          to create RESTful APIs and service-oriented architectures on the back end.
          As a leader, Iâ€™ve managed professional staff on time-sensitive projects,
          cultivated a positive work environment, and developed standard operating procedures.
            <br />
            <br />
          I am passionate about platforms that put communities first and bring users together.
          Engineering allows me to use my creativity to bring things into existence.
          I carry this passion with me in any position, as I have with previous work
          at Uber and Microsoft.
